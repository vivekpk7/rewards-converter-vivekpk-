Task 1:

Added a new class RewardValue.
Created two constructors: one that accepts a cash value and one that accepts a value in miles.
Implemented getCashValue() method, which returns the cash value of the RewardValue.
Implemented getMilesValue() method, which returns how many miles the RewardValue is worth.
Task 2:

Made changes in the RewardValueTest class.
Implemented the convert_from_cash_to_miles and convert_from_miles_to_cash test methods.
All test cases pass successfully.
